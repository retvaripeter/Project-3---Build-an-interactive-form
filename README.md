# Project-3---Build an interactive form

It's about building an interactive, user-friendly form.
The key is the customer validation process and the Progressive Enhancement:  for example, when the JS is removed from the project:
The “Other” text field under the "Job Role" section should be visible
All information for Bitcoin, PayPal or Credit Card payments should be visible.

All other information/explanation are in the comment in app.js.
